kurento-media-server
===================

Kurento Media Server is the Kurento's core element. It is responsible for media
transmission, processing, loading and recording. It is implemented in low level
technologies based on GStreamer to optimize the resource consumption. It
provides the following features:

* Networked streaming protocols, including HTTP, RTP and WebRTC.

* Group communications (MCUs and SFUs functionality) supporting both media
  mixing and media routing/dispatching.

* Generic support for computational vision and augmented reality filters.

* Media storage supporting writing operations for WebM and MP4 and playing in
  all formats supported by GStreamer.

* Automatic media transcodification between any of the codecs supported by
  GStreamer including VP8, H.264, H.263, AMR, OPUS, Speex, G.711, etc.

Compilation instructions
------------------------

First you need to install dependencies, there are various ways, here we describe
one that is pretty simple and automated:

```
  echo "deb http://ubuntu.kurento.org trusty-dev kms6" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento-dev.list
  wget -O - http://ubuntu.kurento.org/kurento.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install $(cat debian/control | sed -e "s/$/\!\!/g" | tr -d '\n' | sed "s/\!\! / /g" | sed "s/\!\!/\n/g" | grep "Build-Depends" | sed "s/Build-Depends: //g" | sed "s/([^)]*)//g" | sed "s/, */ /g")
```

Then you can compile the server, just execute:

```
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4
```

If you want to create a debian package you can execute:

```
  sudo apt-get install devscripts
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  debuild -us -uc  [build文件夹外部执行]
```

Debian packages will be created on parent directory.

Binary distribution
-------------------

This software is distributed as debian packages, you can find stable releases
here using our debian repository.

To install just execute:

```
  echo "deb http://ubuntu.kurento.org trusty kms6" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list
  wget -O - http://ubuntu.kurento.org/kurento.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install kurento-server
```

You can also find current development version at:

http://ubuntu.kurento.org/pool/main/k/kurento-media-server/

To install packages from unstable repository you need to execute:

```
  echo "deb http://ubuntu.kurento.org trusty-dev kms6" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento-dev.list
  wget -O - http://ubuntu.kurento.org/kurento.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install kurento-media-server-6.0
